# Role-Based Room Inventory Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive role-based access control for the room inventory system, with distinct functionality for Housekeeping and Manager users.

## 🧹 Housekeeping User Capabilities

### ✅ What Housekeeping CAN Do:
- **View room inventory** for rooms they clean
- **Update item status** (Used, Missing, Damaged)
- **Request replacements** for missing or damaged items
- **Confirm received items** after manager approval
- **Perform room inventory checks** after guest checkout
- **View their own statistics** (My Rooms, Items Used, Missing Items, My Requests)

### 🚫 What Housekeeping CANNOT Do:
- Add or delete new inventory items
- Edit item information globally (price, quantity per room type)
- Generate full inventory reports
- Approve or manage other users' requests
- Access manager-only features

### 🧩 Example Housekeeping Tasks:
- Room 105: "2 towels missing, request replacement"
- Room 210: "Shampoo refilled, soap replaced"
- Room 315: "TV remote damaged – report sent to manager"

## 👨‍💼 Manager User Capabilities

### ✅ What Managers CAN Do:
- **View all room inventory records** for the entire hotel
- **Add new room inventory items** (e.g., add "Electric Kettle" to all Deluxe Rooms)
- **Edit or update inventory items** assigned to rooms
- **Remove or replace items** in rooms (e.g., mark an old item as "Disposed")
- **Generate reports** for all rooms (missing items, item costs, damages)
- **Approve or deny restock requests** from housekeeping
- **Monitor item condition** and schedule replacements
- **Full access** to all inventory management features

### 🧩 Example Manager Tasks:
- Add new "Bathrobe" to Room 301
- Approve Housekeeping request to replace broken hair dryer
- Generate report of all missing items from rooms this week

- Role-specific action buttons
- Conditional form elements and functionality
- Role-appropriate navigation items

#### Security:
- Server-side role validation on all API endpoints
- Session-based authentication
- Proper error handling and logging

#### Database Schema:

- `room_inventory_transactions` table for audit trail
- Enhanced `rooms` table with housekeeping assignments
- Activity logging for all actions

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Housekeeping Users:
1. Login with housekeeping role
2. Navigate to Room Inventory
3. Select a floor to view assigned rooms
4. Click on room cards to view inventory details
5. Use status buttons (Used/Missing/Damaged) to update items
6. Click "Request Supplies" to create replacement requests
7. Use "Check Rooms" to perform inventory checks

### For Manager Users:
1. Login with manager role
2. Navigate to Room Inventory for full management
3. Use "Request Management" to approve/reject requests
4. Add/remove items from rooms as needed
5. Generate reports and monitor overall inventory

## 🔒 Security Features

- Role-based access control at both UI and API levels
- Session validation on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- Activity logging for audit trails
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## 📊 Database Requirements

Run the SQL file `inventory/database/room_inventory_role_tables.sql` to create the necessary tables:

```sql
-- Creates supply_requests, room_inventory_transactions tables
-- Adds housekeeping assignment columns to rooms table
-- Sets up proper indexes for performance
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Clear Role Separation**: Housekeeping focuses on room-level operations, managers handle global inventory
2. **Improved Workflow**: Streamlined request/approval process
3. **Better Accountability**: All actions are logged and traceable
4. **Enhanced Security**: Role-based access prevents unauthorized actions
5. **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new roles or modify permissions

This implementation provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly role-based inventory management system that meets all the specified requirements.
