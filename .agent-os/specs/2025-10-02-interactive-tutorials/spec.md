## Overview

Implement comprehensive interactive tutorials that provide step-by-step guided learning for all hotel operations modules (POS, Inventory, Booking) with real data simulations and progress tracking for educational institutions.

## User Stories

### Student Learning Journey

As a **Hospitality Student**, I want to access interactive tutorials for each hotel module, so that I can learn real-world hotel operations through guided practice with immediate feedback and progress tracking.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Student logs into the system and accesses the Tutorial Dashboard
2. Student selects a module (POS, Inventory, or Booking) and difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
3. Student follows step-by-step walkthrough with highlighted interface elements
4. Student completes interactive simulations using real hotel data
5. System tracks progress, time spent, and performance scores
6. Student receives immediate feedback and can retry sections as needed

### Instructor Monitoring

As a **Hospitality Instructor**, I want to monitor student tutorial progress and performance, so that I can assess learning outcomes and provide targeted support to struggling students.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Instructor accesses the Tutorial Analytics Dashboard
2. Instructor views completion percentages, time spent, and scores for all students
3. Instructor identifies students who need additional support
4. Instructor can assign specific tutorial modules or difficulty levels to students
5. Instructor generates progress reports for assessment and grading
