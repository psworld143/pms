# POS Index Page Sidebar Fix

## Problem
The sidebar submenu wasn't working on `http://localhost/pms/pos/index.php` - clicking "Restaurant POS" didn't expand the submenu to show "Menu Management" and other options.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Conflicting CSS**
The `index.php` file had embedded CSS that conflicted with the sidebar includes:
- Used old `sidebar-open` class that doesn't exist in the current sidebar
- Had `transform` rules that overrode Tailwind classes
- Z-index conflicts between inline styles and include styles

### 2. **Duplicate Sidebar Overlay**
The `index.php` had its own `sidebar-overlay` div that conflicted with the one in the sidebar include.

### 3. **Missing Console Logging**
The `pos-sidebar.js` file didn't have debug logging, making it hard to troubleshoot.

### 4. **Script Loading Order Issue**
The sidebar JavaScript was being loaded, then the sidebar include tried to redefine the same functions, causing conflicts.

## Changes Made

### File: `/pos/index.php`
**Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed duplicate `sidebar-overlay` div (the include provides this)
2. ✅ Removed conflicting inline CSS for sidebar
3. ✅ Kept only demo-mode indicator CSS (which is specific to index.php)
4. ✅ Re-added `<script src="assets/js/pos-sidebar.js"></script>` that was accidentally removed

**Before:**
```php
<div id="sidebar-overlay" onclick="closeSidebar()"></div>
<?php include 'includes/pos-header.php'; ?>
<?php include 'includes/pos-sidebar.php'; ?>
```
Plus 50+ lines of conflicting CSS

**After:**
```php
<?php include 'includes/pos-header.php'; ?>
<?php include 'includes/pos-sidebar.php'; ?>
```
Only demo-mode CSS remains

### File: `/pos/assets/js/pos-sidebar.js`
**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added console logging to `toggleSubmenu()` function
2. ✅ Added null checks before manipulating DOM elements
3. ✅ Added error logging when elements aren't found

**Before:**
```javascript
function toggleSubmenu(menuKey) {
    const submenu = document.getElementById(`submenu-${menuKey}`);
    const chevron = document.getElementById(`chevron-${menuKey}`);
    if (submenu.classList.contains('hidden')) { ... }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function toggleSubmenu(menuKey) {
    console.log('toggleSubmenu called with key:', menuKey);
    const submenu = document.getElementById(`submenu-${menuKey}`);
    const chevron = document.getElementById(`chevron-${menuKey}`);
    
    console.log('Submenu element:', submenu);
    console.log('Chevron element:', chevron);
    
    if (submenu && chevron) {
        // ... rest of function with logging
    } else {
        console.error('Could not find submenu or chevron for:', menuKey);
    }
}
```

### File: `/pos/includes/pos-sidebar.php`
**Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed duplicate `toggleSubmenu()` inline script
2. ✅ Now relies on the main `pos-sidebar.js` file (loaded by all pages)

This eliminates the duplicate function definition and ensures consistency.

## How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Clear cache and cookies
3. Or do a hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Step 2: Open POS Dashboard
1. Go to: `http://localhost/pms/pos/index.php`
2. Login if needed

### Step 3: Test Sidebar
1. **Open Browser Console** (Press F12, click "Console" tab)
2. **Click "Restaurant POS"** in the sidebar
3. **Watch the Console** - you should see:
   ```
   toggleSubmenu called with key: restaurant
   Submenu element: <ul id="submenu-restaurant">...
   Chevron element: <i id="chevron-restaurant">...
   Showing submenu for: restaurant
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Submenu Expands
After clicking "Restaurant POS", you should see these items appear below it:
- ✅ Menu Management
- ✅ Active Orders
- ✅ Table Management
- ✅ Restaurant Reports

### Step 5: Click Menu Management
1. Click on **"Menu Management"** from the expanded submenu
2. Page should navigate to: `/pms/pos/restaurant/menu.php`
3. Page title should change to: **"Restaurant Menu Management"**
4. Content should show menu management interface (NOT the dashboard)

## Expected Behavior

### Desktop (≥1024px)
- ✅ Sidebar always visible on left
- ✅ Clicking "Restaurant POS" toggles submenu open/closed
- ✅ Chevron rotates when submenu opens
- ✅ Submenu items are clickable
- ✅ Main content has proper left margin

### Mobile (<1024px)
- ✅ Sidebar starts hidden
- ✅ Click hamburger menu (☰) to open sidebar
- ✅ Click "Restaurant POS" to expand submenu
- ✅ Click "Menu Management" to navigate
- ✅ Sidebar automatically closes after navigation

## Verification Checklist

After the fixes, verify:
- [ ] Page loads without JavaScript errors (check console)
- [ ] Sidebar is visible on desktop
- [ ] Clicking "Restaurant POS" expands the submenu
- [ ] Chevron icon rotates when submenu opens
- [ ] "Menu Management" link is visible in submenu
- [ ] Clicking "Menu Management" navigates to the correct page
- [ ] Console shows expected log messages
- [ ] No CSS conflicts (no overlapping elements)
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior works

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Console shows "Could not find submenu or chevron"
**Solution:** The sidebar structure might not be loaded yet. Check:
1. View page source and search for `id="submenu-restaurant"`
2. If not found, the sidebar include might not be loading properly
3. Check file permissions on `/pos/includes/pos-sidebar.php`

### Issue: Submenu expands but links don't work
**Solution:**
1. Check that links have correct URLs in sidebar
2. Verify files exist: `/pos/restaurant/menu.php`, etc.
3. Check session is valid (logged in)

### Issue: Still seeing Point of Sale Dashboard after clicking
**Solution:**
1. You might be clicking "POS Dashboard" instead of "Menu Management"
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Check URL in address bar - should be `/restaurant/menu.php`

## Files Modified Summary

1. ✅ `/pos/index.php` - Removed conflicting CSS, removed duplicate overlay
2. ✅ `/pos/assets/js/pos-sidebar.js` - Added logging and error handling
3. ✅ `/pos/includes/pos-sidebar.php` - Removed duplicate script
